Rules: 

Each round a randomly generated acronym is created. Enter your own expansion like so:

(acroym: TGIF)

Tell the server: 'There's gerbils in Freezer'
Or: 'Then Germany invaded France' 
Or: 'Trump's Government isn't funny'

You get the idea.

Then, all acronyms are voted upon by entering the number of a listed acronym. 

GLHF!
